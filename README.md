# APA 7th Edition for Microsoft Word, German version

Until (unless) Microsoft gets around to adding a template for the latest version, this is the APA 7th Edition XSLT modified by Mike Slagle, plus the two additional fixes posted in the comments found [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/apa-7th-edition-in-ms-word/486fc70e-b7c7-40df-89bb-f8fc07169d40). This way, if other changes are needed, this file can be updated.

## How to Use

### Windows

#### Manual Method
1. Exit Word
2. Using Windows Explorer, copy the file APASeventhEdition.xsl to C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style 
3. Restart Word and from the References tab in Word, you should be able to choose APA7. 

#### Bat file method / Cmd method
1. Exit word
2. Copy the APASeventhEdition.bat file and allow it to run.
3. Restart Word and from the References tab in Word, you should be able to choose APA7. 

Note: The bat file simply runs the following line:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conradthukral/APA-7th-Edition-DE/main/APASeventhEdition.xsl -o "%appdata%\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style\APASeventhEdition.xsl"
